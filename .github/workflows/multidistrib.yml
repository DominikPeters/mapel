    # Due to the fact that the manylinyux action (the following one)
    # runs everything as root, it is MANDATORY to first build sdists (the action above).
    # The issue is that for mapel-elections (the only package containing
    # a C++ extension), the manylinux action creates a directory mapel-elections/src/mapel_elections.egg-info
    # as root. However, the sdist action wants to use this package as no-root
    # which causes permission denied error!

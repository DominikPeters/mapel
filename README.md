# Mapel

Map of elections


# Initial Setup

There are three major ways of using mapel:
1. Copy-paste the sources into your python project and import different `.py`
files directly;
2. (Recommended for developers) Install mapel as an editable package, which simulates a full-fledged global
package installation yet keeping track of all changes to the source code and
applying the on the fly to the "library";
3. (Recommended for library users) Install mapel as a normal package.

Currently, the best choice is point 2, which is subsequently described in this
readme. For a better experience, it is encouraged to use `venv`.

> :exclamation: Note that this library contains C++ extensions. So using it
manually (point 1) requires a correct compilation of the `.cpp` files. How to
do this is beyond the scope of this instruction.


## Editable Package

This variant is especially recommended for developing purposes and for those
who would like to make changes in the code and have the changes reflected. The
instruction includes using `venv`, which is generally a good idea.

1. Install `pip` and `venv`.
2. Prepare a virtual environment running this command:  
`python3 -m venv <virtual_envirnonment_name>`
By default the above command creates a directory `<virtual_environment_name>`,
where the virtual environment files are stored
3. Activate the virtual environment:  
`source <virtual_envirnment_path>/bin/activate`  
If successful, your prompt is now preceded with the name of the virtual environment.
4. Clone the repository and go its directory.
5. Run  
`pip install --editable .`  
This command installs the package, also compiling all necessary C++ extensions
into python-readable libraries.

## Usual Package

This variant is recommended for those, who plan to use mapel without modifying
its source code. The instruction includes using `venv`, which is generally a
good idea.

All steps except from the 5th one are the same as in the Editable Package
variant. The new step 5 is as follows:
5. Run  
`pip install .`
